This project has 3 parts:
1. Use BeautifulSoup as a web scraper to gather information from goodreads.com

2. Store the scraped file into a JSON file for better readability

3. Store the scraped data into a database and/or load the JSON file into the database

Currently the web scraper is working and the data will be collected into 2 JSON files.

The current problem is that no database can be connected. Both mangodb and firebase will not work for now.

The author is currently working on writing tests and using linting.
